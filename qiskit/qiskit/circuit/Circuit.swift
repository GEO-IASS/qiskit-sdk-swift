/**
 Object to represent a quantum circuit as a directed acyclic graph.
 The nodes in the graph are either input/output nodes or operation nodes.
 The operation nodes are elements of a basis that is part of the circuit.
 The QASM definitions of the basis elements are carried with the circuit.
 The edges correspond to qubits or bits in the circuit. A directed edge
 from node A to node B means that the (qu)bit passes from the output of A
 to the input of B. The object's methods allow circuits to be constructed,
 composed, and modified. Some natural properties like depth can be computed
 directly from the graph.
